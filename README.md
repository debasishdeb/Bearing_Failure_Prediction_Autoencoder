# Bearing_Failure_Prediction_Autoencoder
This repository contains the code and necessary files to perform anomaly detection on the NASA Ames Vertical Bearing Dataset using autoencoder neural networks. The goal of this project is to identify unusual patterns or observations in the sensor readings of the bearings, which can be indicative of potential failures or faults. The project utilizes Python programming language and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
Project Structure:
1.	The 'data' folder contains the dataset files downloaded from the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) website. It contains 984 .txt files, one for each bearing.
2.	The 'model' folder contains the saved model files generated by the Python code.
3.	The 'notebooks' folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, data preprocessing, and model training and evaluation.
4.	The 'src' folder contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and anomaly detection.
5.	The 'requirements.txt' file contains the necessary Python packages and dependencies required to run the code.
Instructions for running the code:
1.	Clone or download the repository to your local system.
2.	Install the required packages and dependencies listed in the 'requirements.txt' file by running the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
3.	Navigate to the 'notebooks' folder and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order: a. data_exploration.ipynb b. data_preprocessing.ipynb c. model_training.ipynb
4.	After training the model, navigate to the 'src' folder and run the 'anomaly_detection.py' script to detect anomalies in the bearing dataset.
5.	The detected anomalies will be saved as a .csv file in the 'output' folder.
